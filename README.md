A modern approach to Server Management solution integrated with monitoring & logging pipeline using Docker & Microservices.

# Highlights

- USM is bundled as Docker Images which is lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Hence, no need of host dependencies packages
- USM is an out-of-band system management solution purely based on Redfish API Interface.
- It is a platform agnostic solution(can be run from laptop, server or cloud) and works on any of Linux or Windows platform with Docker Engine running on top of it.

# Value Proposition

- USM architecture can scale both vertically & horizontally
- USM architecture can be easy integrated and extended with 3rd party open source tools.(example - the choice of InfluxDB instead of Prometheus as monitoring tool, using 3rd Party logging tool instead of ELK stack etc.)
- USM bundle can be built and customized by the customer based on their own needs and holds a plug-and-play components and functionalities.
